# Surreal
Surreal is a Deep Learning based <i><b>su</b>per <b>re</b>solution <b>al</b>gorithm</i>

The goal for this project is to provide a generic super resolution algorithm for upscaling images. The first implementation is going to use a conditional DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) so that the generative model operates on perceptual loss - not some kind of hacky euclidean distance metric.

<b>Todos</b>
- Get DCGAN working on MNIST
- Get super-resolution working for MNIST
- Adapt super-resolution code for an RGB dataset
- Easy to use data-generator API which is dataset independent. 

<b>Done</b>
- Modularize and make the model definition code more object-oriented to make future modifications easier.
